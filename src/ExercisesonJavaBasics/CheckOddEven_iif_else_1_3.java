/*
 * Write a program called CheckOddEven which prints "Odd Number" if the 
int variable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise. The program shall 
always print “bye!” before exiting.

Hints

n is an even number if (n % 2) is 0; otherwise, it is an odd number. 
Use == for comparison, e.g., (n % 2) == 0.

    Try number = 0, 1, 88, 99, -1, -2 and verify your results.

    Again, take note of the source-code identation! Make it a good 
    habit to ident your code properly, for ease of reading your program.
